Test independence, binary model
Test binary conditional embeddings of 2 vars, X0 -> X1

* ~~write test for X0~~
* ~~dummy implementation of GPT for X0~~
* ~~real first but flawed implementation for X0~~
* ~~write test for X1 | X0~~
* ~~write test for list ranking~~
* ~~write test for reindexing~~
* ~~refactor implementation for embeddings, including~~
* ~~eliminating list ranking and reindexing methods~~

~~Test embeddings binary X0 -> X1 -> X2~~

Write sanity checks for graph probability tables, e.g.
* I, J, K partition[m] for some m

Package arguments better: s and [m] are same for all GPTs in BN
